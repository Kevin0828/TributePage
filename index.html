                <h2>About Michael</h2>
                   <p>
                    Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was 
                    an American singer, songwriter, and dancer. Dubbed the "King 
                    of Pop", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural 
                    figures of the 20th century and one of the greatest entertainers
                    in the history of music. Through stage and video performances,
                    he popularized complicated dance techniques such as the 
                    moonwalk, to which he gave the name. His sound and style have 
                    influenced artists of various genres, and his contributions 
                    to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized 
                    personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture
                    for over four decades. Jackson is the most awarded artist in
                    the history of popular music.
